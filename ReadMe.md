This script bypasses one of the layers of Steam's security! Don't use it if you're susceptible to phishing.



#### Description:

Script to bypass Steam's link filter. It is (very) simple to make and, as a real IT nerd, I don't trust ppl, so I wrote it instead of using one of already exsting.

I didn't even bothered with changing links or capturing requests, which is probably a more appropriate way to do it.

Others should probably use some other already existing extension for this, like [Steam linkfilter bypasser](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/steam-linkfilter-bypasser/) (which is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sharparam/SteamLinkfilterBypasser)), but I don't mind usage of mine at all.
